                    <strong>About Us</strong><br><br>

                    Door Too Door, herein referred to as "the Company," is a duly established entity engaged in the procurement, restoration (to a commercially reasonable extent), and distribution of pre-owned, salvaged, and otherwise previously utilized door units and related architectural elements.<br><br>
                    
                    The Company operates in strict compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, and regulations governing the acquisition, transportation, and resale of salvaged building materials.<br><br>
                    
                    Our principal objective is to furnish our clientele (hereinafter referred to as "the Customer" or "Purchaser") with door products that are unique in character—bearing the patina, wear, and historical attributes typically associated with items of prior use and significant vintage.<br><br>
                    
                    Door Too Door disclaims any representation that such items conform to contemporary manufacturing standards, except where explicitly stated in writing.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Our Commitment</strong><br><br>
                    
                    We assert our commitment to the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and due diligence in all transactions.<br><br>
                    
                    All door products are sold on an "as-is" basis unless otherwise contractually specified. The Company assumes no liability for incidental or consequential damages arising from the use or installation of any product sold.<br><br>
                    
                    By engaging in commerce with Door Too Door, the Customer acknowledges and accepts the inherent imperfections, idiosyncrasies, and potential variances in quality associated with salvaged materials.<br><br>
                    
                    The Company reserves the right to amend its policies, terms, and conditions at its sole discretion and without prior notice, except where prohibited by law.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Sourcing Statement</strong><br><br>
                    
                    Door Too Door affirms that all door products and architectural materials offered for sale have been procured through methods that, to the best of the Company’s knowledge, comply with—or are reasonably interpreted to align with—ethical acquisition standards and lawful salvage practices.<br><br>
                    
                    The Company makes every commercially reasonable effort to ensure that its inventory is "safely sourced." However, it is acknowledged that certain operational activities may, from time to time, involve complex supply chain dynamics, non-traditional recovery initiatives, or <em>expedient retrieval measures</em> conducted under circumstances of heightened urgency.<br><br>
                    
                    Door Too Door maintains that all such activities are undertaken with the utmost respect for private property rights, municipal ordinances, and—where applicable—the spirit (if not always the precise letter) of the law.<br><br>
                    
                    Customers are hereby assured that each door, while bearing the marks of a storied past, has been acquired through channels deemed, by internal review, to meet a satisfactory threshold of legitimacy and propriety—subject, of course, to ongoing legal interpretations and situational nuances.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Investigation Section</strong><br><br>
                    
                    In the interest of full disclosure and in accordance with principles of procedural fairness, Door Too Door notifies all Customers, partners, affiliates, and interested third parties that the Company and/or its associated entities and/or officers may, at present or in the foreseeable future, be subject to investigative proceedings or inquiries initiated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as "FBI") or other law enforcement or regulatory agencies of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>
                    
                    While the Company neither confirms nor denies the specifics of any ongoing investigatory action, we respectfully advise that no undue scrutiny, audit, or investigatory action be initiated by external parties—whether private individuals, corporate entities, or governmental bodies—without prior consultation with, and express written consent from, the Company’s legal counsel.<br><br>
                    
                    All inquiries of a legal, investigatory, or regulatory nature must be directed through the appropriate formal channels and shall be subject to rigorous procedural safeguards and confidentiality provisions.<br><br>
                    
                    The Company maintains that any and all such proceedings are without prejudice to its continuing commitment to lawful and ethical business practices and affirms its intent to fully cooperate, within the bounds of applicable law, with any duly authorized investigative authority.<br>
                    <br><br>
